# GitHub Assignment Submission  

## Description  
This repository serves as my submission for the GitHub assignment. Although I was unable to access the original assignment, I have followed standard GitHub practices to create and manage a repository. The objective of this submission is to demonstrate my ability to set up a repository, edit files, commit changes, and submit a working project.  

## Steps Taken  
To complete this assignment, I followed these steps:  
1. Created a new repository on GitHub.  
2. Added a **README.md** file to document the submission.  
3. Wrote a structured README file to explain the project.  
4. Committed the changes to ensure all modifications were saved.  
5. Copied the repository link for submission.  

## Challenges Faced  
I encountered difficulty accessing the original assignment, which limited my ability to follow specific instructions. To address this, I created a structured repository based on general GitHub assignment requirements. If any additional modifications are needed, I am open to updating my submission accordingly.  

## Key Learnings  
Through this process, I reinforced my understanding of:  
- Creating and managing repositories on GitHub.  
- Editing and committing files within a repository.  
- Writing clear and structured documentation using Markdown.  
- Submitting a repository link for evaluation.
